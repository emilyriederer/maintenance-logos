## Holiday Hackathon Logos

This repo contains a collection of tacky, holiday-themed hackathon logos. These logos could be used for event branding, laptop stickers, etc. While this project was largely inspired by Digital Ocean's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), each of the themes below hits on specific topics related to repo *maintenance* to encourage upkeep and contribution over novelty and innovation.

## Contributions Welcome!

Right now, the contents of this repo is biased towards holidays and traditions that I'm most familiar with. I do not in any way mean to be exclusive, but I'm most capable of making bad puns about these and it feels most appropriate for me to do so. I welcome contributions that would increase the diversity!

Tech debt [is not a bad thing](https://changelog.com/podcast/379), but it's an investment that needs to get paid down. Take some time to identify and pay down the accumulated debt in your projects.

Dependencies are great for quick prototyping, but do you really need them all when you launch? Re-evaluate and potentially remediate dependencies in your project.

### November

It's time for the fall harvest! If your work isn't on GitHub and optimized for discoverability (README, Description, tags, etc.), harvest them off your hard-drive and bring them into a GitHub repo or org.

Is your code naughty or nice? You'll never know if you don't have unit tests.

All logos were made with [Inkscape](inkscape.org), a great FOSS software.
